This project was part of the Python course for my MIDS master's degree program. The project analyzed a dataset that contained 36,000 notiable computer scientists with information about published works, professional affiliations, news articles and Wikipedia pages. I worked with two classmates. We examined the correlation between a number of factors and whether the scientist had a Wikipedia page.

Based on our exploration, it appeared that whether a scientist has a Wikipedia page is correlated with how well published the scientist is and how often the scientist is quoted in the news.

We were somewhat surprised to see that the gender distribution was the same for scientists who had a Wikipedia page as it was for the entire dataset.
