This project was part of the Python course for my MIDS master's degree program. The project analyzed a dataset that contained 36,000 notiable computer scientists with information about published works, professional affiliations, news articles and Wikipedia pages. I worked with two classmates. We examined the correlation between a number of factors and whether the scientist had a Wikipedia page.

Based on our exploration, it appeared that whether a scientist has a Wikipedia page is correlated with how well published the scientist is and how often the scientist is quoted in the news.

There also seemed to be some correlation between gender and the percentage of scientists who had a Wikipedia page. The percentage of males in the full dataset was 68.8% while the percentage of males in the subset of scientists with Wikipedia pages was 86%. The percentage of female scientists also increased from 10.6% in the full dataset to 12.3% among scientists with Wikipedia pages. We obtained the gender label based on gendered first names. Because of this, the difference in gender distribution seems to be more of an indication of the number of gender neutral or unknown first names than it is of the prevalence of one gender over the other.
