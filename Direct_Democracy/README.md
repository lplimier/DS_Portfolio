Direct democracy is the process that allows an electorate the power to vote legislation into law. An unstated assumption of direct democracy, however, is that the voters exercising this power fully comprehend the text of the legislation and are able to cast a vote that aligns with their
preferences. Voters tend to vote in a manner that is consistent with their underlying values,
beliefs and partisanship (Mendelsohn 1996). Because the United States is a representative
democracy, voters here are accustomed to relying on their representatives to enact legislation
on their behalf. They often rely heavily on policy platforms and party labels— indicators of
values and beliefs—when voting for these representatives. In direct democracy, the information
provided to voters on the ballot itself is stripped of any policy platform or party label and without
these tools, voters are more likely to cast ballots that are not in line with their own preferences
(Bowler & Donovan 1994; Burnett 2019). Providing additional information to voters, beyond
what is presented on the ballot, is one way of simplifying the decision making process for them
thus providing them the opportunity to vote in a manner that is aligned with their own values and
beliefs.

We hypothesized that one way to increase the incentive for voters to vote their preferences
rather than defaulting to the status quo is to provide them with educational materials that lead to
a better understanding of a ballot measure. Supplying the voter with a list of people and
organizations that have endorsed or made a financial contribution to the campaign for the ballot
measure can provide the voter with cues about whether the ballot measure is aligned with their
values, beliefs and partisanship and thus whether they would prefer to vote for or against the
measure. It is the effect of this provision of information to a voter that we study in this
experiment.

We did not find a statistically significant effect of the treatment. Not surprisingly, the degree of support was strongly predicted
by the content of the measure and the respondent's party affiliation. The results suggest a study
designed to have 80% power to detect an effect at p < 0.05 could require up to 450 respondents
per treatment condition for two of the measures and over 409,000 respondents for the third.
